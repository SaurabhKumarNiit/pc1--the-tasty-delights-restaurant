        The Brooklyn Bridge is a hybrid cable-stayed/suspension bridge in New York City, spanning the East River between
        the boroughs of <br>
        Manhattan and Brooklyn. Opened on May 24, 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was the first fixed crossing of the East
        River. It was also the <br>
        longest suspension bridge in the world at the time of its opening,with a main span of 1,595.5 feet (486.3 m) and
        a deck 127 ft(38.7 m) <br>
        above mean high water. The span was originally called the New York and Brooklyn Bridge or the East River Bridge
        but was officially <br>
        renamed the Brooklyn Bridge in 1915. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Bridge">Read more..</a>
